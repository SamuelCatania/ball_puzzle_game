# ball_puzzle_game
A simple puzzle game in which a ball must be navigated through levels full of obstacles.

The aim of this game is to get the RED BALL to the GREEN FINISH SQUARE in each level, 10 levels total. 
You will control the direction of the ball using the arrow keys on your keyboard, with unlimited moves. 
Once in motion, the ball will not stop until it comes into contact with certain squares. 

There are 4 special squares in this game:

	The DARK BLUE SQUARES are unpassable, and will stop the ball coming from any direction.

    The GREEN SQUARES are the finish points - you will have to reach them to finish the level.

    The ORANGE SQUARES are portals. They are always linked to each other, and there will never be more than 
    one set. When the ball enters one ORANGE SQUARE, it will continue in the same direction out of the other 
    ORANGE SQUARE.

    Finally, the BLACK SQUARES WITH PINK TRIANGLES are one-ways. There are 4 kinds of this square, each with 
    a PINK TRIANGLE facing a different direction. The ball can only pass through these squares in the 
    direction the PINK TRIANGLE'S point is pointing (The ball will pass through as long as it is coming 
    from the PINK SIDE).

In any level, you may press the ESCAPE key on your keyboard to pause, and bring up the level number, 
the meaning of each square, and an option to exit, restart or return to the menu. 

KEEP IN MIND: You can only pause when the ball ISN'T moving. 
This is due to the way the program was designed (It checks the color of the pixels on your screen). 
This means that it is very important to have the Puzzle Screen always on top, or at the very front of your computer screen with no overlapping screens/GUIs. 
This prevents any unintentional movement of the ball. Thank you for understanding.
